# MoodDiary
project for CMPUT 301
1. Markers used in map are not finished. Now it may not be obvious on the map.
2. The first district shown in the map is Canada in default. It will be improved to show first the district where a marker is shown.
3. Selecting photo from album is not supported in Android 10.0 (api 29).
4. After pressing back in MapsActivity, MapsActivity will be finished, and a blank Map Fragment will be shown. It will be improved to show Home Fragment after finishing MapsActivity later.
5. In the AddActivity, if a user want to change date and time, date and time picker will be shown only when the user click on the words there. It will be improved later.
6. When internet is poor, photo can be shown slowly in the ViewActivity. A progress bar will be added later.
